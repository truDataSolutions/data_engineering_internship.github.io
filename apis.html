										<h2>What is an API</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											An Application Programming Interface or API for short, is how systems communicate with one
											another without knowing about each other explicitly. They are a set of protocols for
											building and integrating application software. Generally, APIs are a part of a server that receives
											requests and sends responses. Most companies/websites have some kind of API available to the
											public. However, it is possible for companies to have private APIs which do not allow public 
											access. It is all dependent on the APIs security management.<br><br>
											Applications that call APIs were traditionally written specific different programming languages. Web APIs
											can be called through any programming language, but webpages created in HTML or application generator tools
											can access them too.
										</p><br>
										<h2>How APIs Work</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											APIs are made of two related elements:<br>
											- A specification that describes how information is exchanged between programs in the form of a request.<br>
											- A software interface written to that specification and published in some way of use.<br>
											Software that want to access what the API has to offer is said to call it, and the software tha creates
											the API is said to publish it. APIs provide an audit trail whether it is a public, private, or partnered API
											as you are required to have a token to access them. APIs have predefined roles that govern what service can
											specifically be accessed and granted.
										</p><br><br>
										<h2>REST APIs</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											The most common architectures of APIs are Representational State Transfer (or REST) and Simple Object Access
											Protocol (or SOAP). Here we will touch upon both, but will go into much further detail regarding REST
											APIs. SOAP is a protocol that follows a strict standard to allow communication between the client and 
											the server. REST on the other hand is an architectural style tha doesn't follow any strict standard but
											follows six general constraints defined by Roy Fielding in his dissertation 
											<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf"><i>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture</i></a>.
											In his disseration, Fielding states that a REST API must be:
											<ul class="style3">
												<li><strong>Uniform Interface</strong></li>
												<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
													This constraint is core to the design of RESTful APIs and includes 4 facets:<br>
													<strong>1. Resource identification in requests</strong><br>
													<strong>2. Resource manipulation through representation</strong><br>
													<strong>3. Self-descriptive messages returned have enough information to describe how the client to proceed</strong><br>
													<strong>4. Hypertext is available</strong><br>
												</p>
												<li><strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong></li>
												<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
													REST architecture is composed of clients, servers, and resources, and it handles requests
													through HTTP.
												</p>
												<li><strong>Stateless</strong></li>
												<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
													No client content is stored on the server between requests. Information about the session
													state is, instead, held with the client.
												</p>
												<li><strong>Cacheable</strong></li>
												<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
													Caching can eliminate the need for some client-server interactions.
												</p>
												<li><strong>Layered System</strong></li>
												<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
													Client-server interactions can be mediated by additional layers. These layers could offer
													additional features like load balancing, shared caches, or security.
												</p>
												<li><strong>Code on Demand</strong></li>
												<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
													Servers can extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code.
												</p>
											</ul>
										</p><br>
										<h2>RESTful Best Practices</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Due to REST APIs being very flexible, this also bring up an easy point of error as the API can be designed
											poorly which would result in the functionality being hindered. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) established
											that an interface for describing an API must have a way that allows any developer or application to discover
											it and fully understand its parameters and capabilities. Another best practice when building an API is to
											hash passwords and using HTTPS for secure data transmission.
										</p><br>
										<h2>Postman</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Postman is used to disect, understand, and test REST APIs. It is an almost no code solution to understand other APIs functionality. 
											An good example of how Postman could be implemented
											is looking at testing a community API. If we are using a coding interface (in this case Flask), we would have
											to write out a bunch of code to test a GET request. You would need to write a new route and function to test the request.
											With Postman this process is all streamlined for users. You will need to enter the route address, enter and API key,
											and select which kind of request you are testing.
