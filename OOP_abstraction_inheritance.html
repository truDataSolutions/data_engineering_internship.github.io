										<h2>What is Object Oriented Programming</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Object Oriented Programming or OOP for short is the practice of organizing software design
											around objects rather than functions and logic. OOP focuses on the objects the developers
											want to manipulate rather than the logic to manipulate them. This approach is well suited
											for projects tha are large, complex, and actively updated and maintained.
										</p>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											OOP also follows a general structure. This includes <strong>classes</strong>, <strong>objects</strong>,
											<strong>methods</strong>, and <strong>attributes</strong>.<br><br>
											<!--intro to classes-->
											<strong>Classes</strong> are a data structure that act as a blueprint for an individual object, methods, and attributes.
											An example of a class would be a "Dog". The Dog class will consist of methods and attributes. A method could be an action
											such as bark, scratch, or jump while an attribute would consist of things such as fur color, age, or sex. To use a class
											you need to initialize the object created from this class. Programming languages due this differently. For example, Python
											would require the __init__() function to initialize an object. C# on the other hand has you create a class, then initialize it 
											in your program. Below is an example of both.<br><br>
											<img src="images/dog_class_c_python.JPG" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><br>
											
											<!--intro to methods-->
											<strong>Methods</strong> are functions that are associated with a class object. In the section above we went over the creating
											a dog class with attributes <i>Name</i> and <i>Breed</i>. We can also add methods to the class which would enable our dog to have
											a bit more functionality.<br><br>
											<img src="images/dog_method_c_python.JPG" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><br>

											<!--intro to attributes-->
											<strong>Attributes</strong> are properties of a class that have data stored in the attribute fields. Usually attributes
											are descriptive properties for the object. Above we saw that the Dog class has attributes <i>Name</i> and <i>Breed</i>. We
											could also extend these attributes to non-descriptive properties such as e-mail, address, etc.,
										</p><br>
										<h2>Abstraction</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
										    <strong>Abstraction</strong> is the process of removing or hiding something to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics.
											Through abstractions, a programmer can hide all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase
											efficiency. A good example here would be you are meeting someone on a dating app. On the app you can see their hair color, height,
											age, and perhaps a hobby they have. What is hidden from you is their social security number, their address, and other sensitive
											information.
										</p><br>

										<h2>Inheritance</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											<strong>Inheritance</strong> is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward concept of OOP to understand. It allows programmers
											to create class hierarchies, where classes and objects <strong>inherit</strong> properties and behaviors from their parent class.
											The parent class is the superclass while the child class is often referred to as the subclass. The key feature of inheritance is
											reusability. A good example would be the person class as parent and teach or any kid of job as a child. Every person needs the
											same basic function which could be sleep(), eat(), drink(), etc. This means we could use the parent class as to no re-write these
											functions several time. We then have the teach subclass which inherits from the person class. Here we would have functions that
											are unique to a teach such as teachClass(), roleCall(), etc. This ultimately reduces overall complexity and allows you the programmer
											to complete tasks much faster!
