										<h2>What is Software Architecture</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Software architecture is the patterns used to scale and meet user' demands for a given application. There are several
											different kinds of software architectural patterns to follow, but there is not a single that is better than all the others,
											each has their specific use cases. Here we will discuss n-tier architecture, microservice architecture, and event driven architecture.<br><br>
											
											You can think of a software architecture pattern as a blueprint for a project. However, its a reusable solutions as each
											pattern has a predefined set of subsystems, roles, and responsibilities. Having the knowledge of different patterns allows
											you to address concerns in regards to performance, limitations, and minimizing business risk.<br><br>

											Software architecture also play a vital role in any software application and here is why:<br>
											- <strong><i>Defines basic characteristics of an application</i></strong><br>
											- <strong><i>Maintains quality and efficiency</i></strong><br>
											- <strong><i>Provides agility</i></strong><br>
											- <strong><i>Problem solving</i></strong><br>
											- <strong><i>Enhances productivity</i></strong>
										</p>
										<!--Layered architecture-->
										<h2>N-Tier Architecture</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											N-tiered architecture (also known as layered architecture and tiered architecture) is the most common software architecture
											pattern today. It simplifies the increasing complexity of modern applications and promotes the agile framework which benefits
											DevOps environments and other methodologies that utilize agile. So why is this architecture patterned named the way it is?
											Well, that is because it consists of several layers, each of which hold their own service or integration to the overall application.
											Because each layer is separated, it makes it much easier to edit the layer without changing the overall architecture.
											We will look at a very simple example of a 3-tiered architecture below.
										</p><br>
										<ul class="style2">
											<li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong></li>
											<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
												The presentation layer is the top layer of this architecture pattern. Here we have how the content is presented to the user
												through a GUI. This tier can be accessed through any kind of device (tablet, laptop, desktop, etc.,) and must interact with
												a web browser to display the page the user is targeting. To present the content it is essential for this tier to speak to 
												other tiers in the architecture that precede it.
											</p>
											<li><strong>Application Layer</strong></li>
											<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
												The application (or logic) layer is the middle tier of the 3-layer architecture pattern. Here is where the applications business logic is ran.
												Business logic it the set of rules that are required for running the application as per the guidelines laid down by
												the lead organization.
											</p>
											<li><strong>Data Layer</strong></li>
											<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
												The data layer is the bottom most layer in the 3-tier architecture pattern. Here we see how the data is stored and 
												retrieved for the application. Typically we see the data stored on a database server or any other form of media device
												that supports access logic and provides the necessary steps to ensure only the data is exposed and not any form of
												sensitive information(such as access to the underlying system). This is generally done by the data layer providing an
												API token to the Application layer. The use of the API ensures complete transparency to the data operations being performed
												without affected the application tier.
											</p>
										</ul>
										<img src="images/thumbnails/3tier.png">
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											A 3-tier architecture pattern is a simple example of n-tier architecture. However, it is possible for it to become much more
											complex. You can create a multi-tier architecture (hence why the name is n-tier as you can continue to add layers) by splitting
											the application layer further. Due to the extra dimension in the application layer, in theory it becomes more scalable and adds
											additional dimensions of functionality.<br><br>

											Now we understand what tiered architecture is, how what are its benefits? Well, the primary benefit (as stated before), is the fact
											that due to the layers being separated it allows for you to maintain and manage each layer accordingly without interfering with the
											other layers. In addition, the multi-layered approach is particularly good for developing web-scale, production-grade, and
											cloud-hosted applications very quickly.
										</p><br>
										<h2>Microservice Architecture</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											A microservice architecture pattern is one where the system has multiple services that each are responsible for
											a discrete task. These service can comminate with each other in order to solve a larger complex business task.
										</p><br>
										<h2>Event-driven Architecture</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Event-drive architecture is a design pattern built to record, transmit, and process events through a decoupling.
											This means that the systems don't need to know about each other to share information and accomplish tasks.
											Decoupling offers a major advantage over other data sharing methods such as APIs. With decoupling, an event
											producer sends its notification without needing to know what happens after (whereas an API will always have
											a request and response). This leaves the rest of the event up to the event-router (as known as a broker) to
											decide where the data needs to go.
