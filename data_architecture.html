										<h2>Data Warehouse</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											A data warehouse is perhaps the most common data architecture you will see at companies. It is a repository 
											for storing large amounts of data from multiple sources within an organization. In essence, it is a place
											where many databases are store. In general, data warehouses store historical data and are organized in a 
											relational database management system.<br><br>

											Data warehouses go through the ETL process so that individuals who need to work with the data have it in 
											a prepared fashion. This means the data is cleaned and ready for production right out of the box.<br><br>

											<img src="images/data_warehouse.png" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><br>

											Within a data warehouse we can also have a transactional database. In general, you will never touch a 
											transactional database as this is where production is run. Any kind of error or bug may bring down 
											production. Transactional databases stores day to day operations and uses INSERT and UPDATE 
											statements. <br><br>

											The benefits of a data warehouse would be that storing data in this manner gives improvement to 
											standardization - consistent formatting of tables, quality - a clear set of instructions as to 
											how the data is set-up, and consistency. It will also increase the speed at which analytics and 
											business intelligence can flow. <br><br>

											There are some draw backs to data warehouses as well such as lack of flexibility. Due to their 
											nature, they excel with structured data but struggle with semi and unstructured data. They also 
											have a high implementation costs.<br><br>

											<strong>Snowflake Data Warehouse</strong><br><br>

											Snowflake is a data warehouse that allows for storage, processing, and analysis that are 
											more flexible than traditional offerings. A huge draw to Snowflake is its separation of compute 
											and storage. This allows organizations to scale dynamically and can lower the overall cost of 
											the data warehouse.<br><br>
										</p>
										<h2>Data Lake</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											A data lake is a highly flexible storage repository that stores structured and unstructured data in 
											its raw, unformatted form. In contrast to a data warehouse which stores cleaned data, a data lake 
											uses a flat architecture and organizes its contents in their raw form. Data lakes are very flexible 
											and cost-effective which still giving an organization the ability to gain insight from their data.<br><br>

											With data lakes, the data follows an ELT schema rather than the ETL of the data warehouse. This means 
											that data is loaded into the data center in its raw, untouched, unaltered form. Due to this there 
											is large flexibility if the data being pulled. Due to this, data lakes are generally better for 
											machine learning and data science.<br><br>

											<img src="images/data_lake_pattern.png" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" /><br><br>

											There are some drawbacks to data lakes. Due to its unformatted and unstructured nature, its 
											performances is significantly lower than a data warehouse for data analytics and business 
											intelligence uses. It also lacks reliability and security. Since the data in data lakes are 
											stored in a raw format it is difficult to enforce consistency. Also, because data lakes 
											support all data formats, it is difficult to implement proper security measures.<br><br>

											<strong>Snowflake Data Lake</strong><br><br>

											Snowflake can operate as both a data warehouse and a data lake. It has native support 
											for both structured and unstructured data making it an excellent tool for organizations 
											needing a one and done solution.<br>
											<h2>Delta Lake</h2>
											<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
												Delta lakes are a relatively new concept and is yet to be widely adopted. It essentially provides 
												reliability to the data lake architecture. They support ACID transactions, rollbacks, and unified 
												streaming and batch data processing. Delta lakes run onto of pre-existing data lakes. In short, 
												delta lakes take some of the best properties of a data warehouse and lay them onto of a data lake 
												resulting in an extremely dynamic and robust data system.<br><br>
	
												Delta lakes are also separated into different tiers. The bronze tier offers a storage solutions 
												for the raw data. We then move up to the silver tier which the data is cleaned and placed in a 
												schema. At the gold tier, the data is ready for production and can be pulled and used immediately. <br><br>
	
												<img src="images/delta_lake_diag.png" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" /><br><br>
	
												The downside to the delta lake architecture is that you must maintain two system which can be 
												expensive for an organization. Since you have a data lake as the base and a delta lake overlay, 
												you need admins to maintain both systems else you risk failure.<br><br>
	
												<strong>Databricks</strong><br><br>
	
												Databricks offers a delta lake architecture that is just a storage layer over their data lake 
												system. It is compatible with the Apache Spark APIs which allows for very robust operations 
												over the organizations data.<br>

										<h2>Exercise: Setting up Snowflake</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;margin-left:40px;">
											1. Now that you know the main data architectures lets set-up a Snowflake environment. Navigate to 
											the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> website. In the top right corner, there is a “start for free” button”, click it.<br><br>

											2. Next you will want to fill out your information and click continue.<br><br>

											3. On the next panel you will be greeted with multiple options to select from. I recommend selecting the standard edition of Snowflake. 
											Although it is unlikely you will use the free $400 of resources, on the other two options it is more likely to consume the 
											credits at a faster rate. For your cloud provider choose Amazon Web Services. Lastly select the server that is nearest to you. 
											Finally, click “Get started”.<br><br>

											4. Once you&#39ve finished signing up you will need to active your account before you are able to log into Snowflake. Check the email 
											you signed-up with. You should have received a link. Click it and create a Username and Password.<br><br>

											5. Once you are successfully logged in you will be greeted with home page.<br><br>

											6. From the home page, navigate to “Databases”.<br><br>

											7. Hit “Create” and name your database.<br><br>

											8. Now that your database is created, it should show up in the list of databases available. Click on it. In the top right there 
											is a “create” button. Select this and let&#39s recreate the employee table from the <a href="sql.html" target="_blank">SQL</a> section. As a note, do not forget to 
											alter the value next to VARCHAR. Otherwise, the creation will throw an error.<br><br>

											9. Next let&#39s create a warehouse. To create a warehouse, you should follow similar instructions as when we created the database. Select a name, 
											size should be the smallest one possible for this example I chose X-Small. Leave the rest of the settings as default.<br><br>

											10. You will need to download the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-install-config.html">SnowflakeCLI</a>.
											This will allow you to access Snowflake from the command line.<br><br>

											11. In a Snowflake worksheet (or a text editor) create a table to store your data in. I would recommend to have all the data types
											for each column to be set to VARCHAR for now. This is a RAW table and for data ingestion purposes will help us later. We will fix
											this at a later stage.<br><br>
											<img src="images/creat_table_snowflake.png"><br><br>

											12. Using the Snowflake CLI we can access Snowflake from a terminal. Here, we will create a connection with our Snowflake instance.
											To do so, we will need a few things: Snowflake Account ID, Snowflake Username, and Snowflake Password. Your Account ID is the string
											Presented to you when logging into Snowflake. On the command line run the command below to create a connection:
											<p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em;">
												snowsql -a &lt;account_id&gt; -u &lt;username&gt; *hit enter and then input your password*
											</p> 
										</p>

										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;margin-left:40px;">
											13. Use the 'USE' command to assign a schema schema(if working outside PUBLIC SCHEMA), data warehouse, and database.<br><br>
											 <img src="images/snowflake_use.png"><br><br>

											14. We will need to create a <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stage.html">staging</a> area for our
											data to be able to be imported into Snowflake.<br><br>

											15. Using the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/put.html">PUT</a> command you can place the CSV file into
											your staging area.<br><br>

											16. Using the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.html">COPY</a> command, copy the staged file to a new table in Snowflake.<br><br>

											17. Run a SQL query to ensure the new table has been populated correctly.
